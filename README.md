# EEP520-W20-final-project
Final project using ENVIRO

The inspiration for this project is a callback to classical shoot 'em up (or shmup) games that prevailed during the third generation of video game consoles.
While this project is far from complete, and is not nearly as optimized as I would have desired, it is my hope that it may be seen as a humble homage to what
was once a dominant genre in video games.
